1. complicated_patterns.png visualizes three different target patterns.
2. loss_curve.png visualizes the loss curve of the two-stage training process in BackTime.
    - We use the same color to plot the loss within the same epoch.
    - During each epoch, we run the clean training first, as shown in the upper figure, and then update the trigger generator, as shown in the lower figure
